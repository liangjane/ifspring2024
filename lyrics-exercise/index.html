        <div class="lyrics">She'd take the world off my shoulders 
            If it was ever hard to move 
            She'd turn the rain to a rainbow 
            When I was living in the blue 
            Why then, if she is so perfect 
            Do I still wish that it was you? 
            Perfect don't mean that it's working 
            So what can I do? (Ooh)  

            When you're out of sight 
            In my mind  

            'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes 
            And that's where I find a glimpse of us 
            And I try to fall for her touch 
            But I'm thinking of the way it was 
            Said I'm fine and said I moved on 
            I'm only here passing time in her arms 
            Hoping I'll find 
            A glimpse of us

            Tell me he savors your glory 
            Does he laugh the way I did? 
            Is this a part of your story? 
            One that I had never lived 
            Maybe one day you'll feel lonely 
            And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse 
            Maybe you'll start slipping slowly 
            And find me again  

            When you're out of sight 
            In my mind  

            'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes 
            And that's where I find a glimpse of us 
            And I try to fall for her touch 
            But I'm thinking of the way it was 
            Said I'm fine and said I moved on 
            I'm only here passing time in her arms 
            Hoping I'll find 
            A glimpse of us 

            Ooh, ooh-ooh 
            Ooh, ooh-ooh 
            Ooh, ooh, ooh  

            'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes 
            And that's where I find a glimpse of us 
            And I try to fall for her touch 
            But I'm thinking of the way it was 
            Said I'm fine and said I moved on 
            I'm only here passing time in her arms 
            Hoping I'll find 
            A glimpse of us

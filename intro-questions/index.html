        <ol style="padding-left: 7.5%; padding-right: 7.5%;">
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc)</li>
            <p>My name is Jane, and I am junior. I am majoring in BME with CS minor.</p>

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li>
            <p>This class seemed like the perfect integration between exploring front end development and design. I have always been interested in deseign and wanted to explore a different area of software development.</p>

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li>
            <p>I have had minimal exposure to HTML/CSS/JS. </p>

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li>
            <p>I hope to become comfortable with using HTML/CSS and design interesting and effective websites.</p>

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li>
            <p>I expect designing for screen to be more involved as there is an extra step from code to design. Additionally, the "canvas" is almost limitless on screen.</p>

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li>
            <p>I believe that <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/">IKEA</a> is an example of effective design. The front page has aesthetic pictures of living spaces decorated with IKEA pieces. The pieces are linked on the picture itself, allowing for easy access to the links and items. When you click the item, basic information from size to material and local availablilitly is shown. </p>

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li>
            <p>I think that <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix's website</a> is an expample of effective design. It presents the user with a selection of their titles that might appeal to the user. When you hover over a title, a short review and a list of genres appear to entice you. All the while, the website is recognizable at first glace due to its black blackground and distinct red logo.</p>

            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li>
            <p>A website that works well is <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/mail/">Outlook</a>. It presents information in an ordered way and allows for timely and effective communcation. It also allows for users to categorize and flag their incoming mail, creating a better user experience.</p>

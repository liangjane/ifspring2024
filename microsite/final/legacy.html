                <div><p>Barbie was released on the same day as Oppenheimer, a biographical film about J. Robert Oppenheimer written
                    and directed by Christopher Nolan based on the book American Prometheus, and distributed by Universal
                    Pictures. Due to the tonal and genre contrast between the two films, many social media users created memes
                    and ironic posts about how the two films appealed to different audiences,and how they should be viewed
                    as a double feature. Hence, the trend was dubbed "Barbenheimer." In an interview with La
                    Vanguardia, Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy endorsed the phenomenon, saying, "My advice would be for people
                    to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain." The Barbenheimer
                    phenomenon was widely credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over
                    the weekend (52% for Barbie) being for the two films, a total of 18.5 million people.</p></div>

                <h2>Box Office</h2>
                <p>Barbie grossed $636.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $809.4 million in other territories, for a
                    worldwide total of $1.446 billion.This was described by Warner Bros. as "reaching a Barbillion."
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was described as a "record-breaking" box office success during its opening weekend,and
                    set the record for any film that was not a sequel, remake, or superhero property.Barbie became the
                    highest-grossing live-action comedy film of all time, smashing the domestic record formerly held by Home
                    Alone (1990) and the worldwide record formerly held by The Hangover Part II (2011) simultaneously.It
                    has also become Gerwig's highest-grossing film, overtaking its predecessor Little Women (2019). The
                    film crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide on August 6, 2023, making it the first film by a solo female
                    director to do so. This was also the fastest Warner Bros. film to reach $1 billion, beating Harry
                    Potter and the Deathly Hallows &mdash Part 2 (2011). In late August, Barbie surpassed that same film
                    again, becoming Warner Bros.'s highest-grossing film, not adjusted for inflation. By September 2, the
                    film surpassed $1.365 billion at the global box office, replacing The Super Mario Bros. Movie as the
                    highest-grossing film of the year. Additionally, it became the highest-grossing film by a solo
                    female director, surpassing the previous record held by Jia Ling for Hi, Mom (2021).</p>

                <h2>Accolades</h2>
                <p>The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Barbie one of the top-ten films of
                    2023. The film's soundtrack album and score received 12 nominations at the 66th Annual Grammy
                    Awards. Barbie tied with Cabaret (1972) for the second-most nominations in Golden Globe Awards history,
                    earning a leading nine at the 81st edition. It would ultimately win two awards at the ceremony, including
                    Best Original Song (for "What Was I Made For") and the inaugural Golden Globe for Cinematic and Box Office
                    Achievement.</p>
                <p>Earning 18 nominations at its 29th ceremony, the film received the most nominations in Critics' Choice Movie
                    Awards history. Longlisted in 15 categories at the 77th British Academy Film Awards, Barbie (along
                    with Oppenheimer and Killers of the Flower Moon) equalled the BAFTA longlist record for most nominations set
                    by Edward Berger's German anti-war film All Quiet on the Western Front (2022). It also received eight
                    nominations at the 96th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting
                    Actor (Gosling), Best Supporting Actress (Ferrera) and two nominations for Best Original Song (for "I'm Just
                    Ken" and "What Was I Made For"). It eventually won Best Original Song (for "What Was I Made
                    For").</p>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>The idea of a live-action Barbie film was in development at Cannon Films in the <em>mid-1980s</em>.
                Renewed
                development on a film based on the Barbie toy line began in <em>September 2009</em>, when it was
                announced that
                Mattel had signed a partnership with Universal Pictures and producer Laurence Mark, but nothing came to
                fruition. In <em>April 2014</em>, Mattel teamed with Sony Pictures to produce the film, which would have
                Jenny
                Bicks
                writing the screenplay and Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes producing through their
                Parkes+MacDonald
                Image Nation banner. Filming was anticipated to begin by the end of the year. In <em>March 2015</em>,
                Diablo Cody
                was
                brought onto the project to rewrite the screenplay, and Amy Pascal joined the producing team.
            </p>
            <p>In <em>December 2016</em>, Amy Schumer entered negotiations for the title role with Winston's screenplay.
                She
                helped
                rewrite the script with her sister, Kim Caramele. In <em>March 2017</em>, she exited negotiations,
                initially saying it was due to scheduling conflicts with the planned June 2017 filming; she revealed in
                2023 that she left due to creative differences with the film's producers. That July, Anne Hathaway was
                considered for the
                title
                role; Sony hired Olivia Milch to rewrite the screenplay and approached Alethea Jones to direct as a
                means of
                interesting Hathaway in signing. Jones was attached to direct by March 2018.
            </p>
            <p>In <em>August 2018</em>, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz hired film executive Robbie Brenner, who was later
                appointed head
                of
                Mattel Films. Sony's option on the project expired in <em>October 2018</em>, and film rights were
                transferred to
                Warner Bros. Pictures, causing Hathaway, Jones, Macdonald, Parkes and Pascal to leave them project. </p>
            <p>Margot Robbie entered early talks for the role, and Patty Jenkins was briefly considered as director.
                Kreiz
                was determined to cast Robbie after meeting with her; both he and Brenner felt that Robbie's appearance
                resembled that of a conventional Barbie doll and were impressed by her ideas. Initial meetings occurred
                at
                the Polo Lounge located in The Beverly Hills Hotel. Brenner eventually partnered with Robbie's
                production
                company, LuckyChap Entertainment, and Robbie's husband Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara were enlisted as
                producers. Robbie's casting was confirmed in <em>July 2019</em>.
            </p>
            <p>In her capacity as a producer, Robbie pitched Barbie to Warner Bros. herself. During the green-light
                meeting,
                she compared the film to Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993) and also jokingly suggested that it
                would
                gross over $1 billion. Later on, she approached Greta Gerwig—whose previous films, particularly Little
                Women
                (2019), Robbie enjoyed—to screenwrite. Gerwig was in post-production for another film, and took the
                assignment on the condition that her partner, Noah Baumbach, also write the script. Gerwig would sign on
                to also direct the film in <em>July 2021</em>. Robbie said the film aimed at subverting expectations and
                giving audiences "the thing you didn't know you wanted."</p>

                <h2>Writing</h2>
                <p>As writers, Gerwig and Baumbach were given full creative freedom. They worked on the screenplay
                    during the
                    2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns at their house in Long Island. Baumbach felt he understood the
                    film's
                    purpose once Gerwig had shown him the first scene, identifying the "element" as "embracing mortality
                    and
                    sadness and sickness and everything that it means to be human." Gerwig was also inspired by the
                    real-life
                    story of Barbie creator Ruth Handler. Gerwig's film treatment consisted of an abstract poem on
                    Barbie
                    influenced by the Apostles' Creed. For the narrative arc, she was partially inspired by the
                    non-fiction book
                    Reviving Ophelia (1994) by Mary Pipher, which accounts the effects of societal pressures on American
                    teenage
                    girls. She also found inspiration in classic Technicolor musicals such as The Red Shoes (1948) and
                    The
                    Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964), and said: "They have such a high level of what we came to call
                    authentic
                    artificiality. You have a painted sky in a soundstage. Which is an illusion, but it's also really
                    there. The
                    painted backdrop is really there. The tangibility of the artifice is something that we kept going
                    back
                    to." The script also contains candid criticism of Mattel, which created skepticism among Mattel
                    officials when they received the first version. However, Kreiz decided to trust Gerwig. Brenner
                    noted that
                    "being safe in this world doesn't work" as she interpreted Barbie to be a "bold" and "trailblazer"
                    figure.
                    As a result, Will Ferrell's portrayal as the Mattel CEO was meant to be an allegory for corporate
                    America.
                    Kreiz praised Ferrell and said that while Mattel officials took their brands seriously, they did not
                    take
                    themselves seriously. Gerwig and Robbie had felt the film was "most certainly a feminist film", but
                    Mattel officials rejected the description. Gerwig and Robbie informed the studio that they would
                    explore the
                    controversies and problematic parts of Barbie, but also convinced the studio that they would respect
                    the
                    product.

                <p class="caption">Greta Gerwig <i>(Clement Pascal for The New York Times)<i></p>

                <p>Gerwig was also influenced by her childhood experiences with Barbie. Her mother discouraged her from
                    purchasing such dolls, but eventually allowed her to. Opting to acknowledge the controversial nature
                    of
                    the Barbie doll, Gerwig chose to create a film where she would be both "doing the thing and
                    subverting the
                    thing", in the sense that she would be celebrating the feminism behind Barbie while also noting the
                    controversial beauty standards associated with it. She was also fascinated by the idea that humans
                    created
                    dolls, which in turn imitate humans, feeling that "we're in constant conversation with inanimate
                    objects"
                    while also conveying an affirmative message to the audience to "just be yourself and know that
                    that's
                    enough." The film deliberately juxtaposed contradictory messaging, such as critiquing consumerism
                    yet
                    glamorizing plastic products; and in the film's ending, where Barbie desires to be more than just a
                    plastic
                    doll. Gerwig made the film as an "earnest attempt to make amends" between affirming womens' worth
                    and
                    conveying the impossibility of perfection, which some perceived to be standards associated with
                    Barbie.

                    standards associated with it"</h3>

                <p>
                    Reflecting upon the maximalism of Barbie, Gerwig said the "ontology of Barbie" was similar to what
                    she
                    perceived as William Shakespeare's maximalism, which she enjoyed in his works. She grounded the film
                    in what
                    she described as a "heightened theatricality that allows you to deal with big ideas in the midst of
                    anarchic
                    play." She also described the film as being anarchic, unhinged, and humanist. She felt the film
                    originated from the "deep isolation of the pandemic", opining that the line in which Barbie says "Do
                    you
                    guys ever think about dying?" exemplifies the film's anarchic nature. She also found the idea of
                    Barbie
                    being "constrained in multitudes" as "all of these women are Barbie and Barbie is all of these
                    women" to be
                    "trippy" and felt as a result, Barbie did not need to have her own personal life, as she was attuned
                    to her
                    environment. She also described the story as mirroring a girl's journey from childhood to
                    adolescence,
                    though she did not deem it to be a coming of age film and felt that the film ultimately "ends up,
                    really,
                    about being human."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Primarily, she began her writing by interpreting Barbie as living in a utopia and eventually
                    experiencing
                    reality, where she would have to "confront all the things that were shielded from them in this place
                    [Barbieland]." She also drew parallels to the story of Adam and Eve and taking inspiration from John
                    Milton's Paradise Lost, particularly being inspired by the concept that there is "no poetry without
                    pain." To underscore the tragic elements of Barbie and Ken facing the real world, she focused on
                    elements of dissonance. As such, she chose to keep a scene featuring Robbie's Barbie telling an
                    older
                    woman that she is beautiful after being requested to remove it, as she felt that the scene
                    epitomized "the
                    heart of the movie." She also desired to provide a "counterargument" to Barbie by featuring a scene
                    in which
                    Barbie learns that some women do not like her, and felt it gave the film "real intellectual and
                    emotional
                    power." As such, a scene is featured in which Barbie is being stared at inappropriately on the
                    Venice
                    Beach, which Gerwig chose to feature as she felt it was a universal experience, being especially
                    relevant
                    for actors. She was inspired by an audition she did in which she wore overalls and felt that she did
                    not
                    perform well in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ending of the film features Barbie saying the line "I'm here to see my gynecologist", with
                    Gerwig describing it as a "mic drop kind of joke." She had chosen to include the line as she had wanted to instill confidence in younger girls, as she had been embarrassed about her body when she was younger. Barbie also explores the negative consequences of hierarchical power structures, with Gerwig saying that  she extrapolated that "Barbies rule and Kens are an underclass" and felt it was similar to the Planet of the Apes. Ken has low self-esteem and seeks approval from Barbie, which Gerwig identified as a good source for a story. Gosling compared Gerwig's vision to Milton Glaser's I Love New York logo as he felt Gerwig created the film's characters as a way of understanding the contemporary world. Ken has the only power ballad in the film, and Gerwig had identified it as the moment in which she felt the film transcended what a Barbie film traditionally should have been.</p>

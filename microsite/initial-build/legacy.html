        <h2>Barbenheimer</h2>
        <p>Barbie was released on the same day as Oppenheimer, a biographical film about J. Robert Oppenheimer written
            and directed by Christopher Nolan based on the book American Prometheus, and distributed by Universal
            Pictures. Due to the tonal and genre contrast between the two films, many social media users created memes
            and ironic posts about how the two films appealed to different audiences,[178] and how they should be viewed
            as a double feature.[179][180] Hence, the trend was dubbed "Barbenheimer."[181] In an interview with La
            Vanguardia, Oppenheimer star Cillian Murphy endorsed the phenomenon, saying, "My advice would be for people
            to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain."[182] The Barbenheimer
            phenomenon was widely credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over
            the weekend (52% for Barbie) being for the two films, a total of 18.5 million people.[4]</p>

        <h2>Box Office</h2>
        <p>Barbie grossed $636.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $809.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.446 billion.[6][7] This was described by Warner Bros. as "reaching a Barbillion."[231]
        </p>
        <p>
            It was described as a "record-breaking" box office success during its opening weekend,[232][233][234] and
            set the record for any film that was not a sequel, remake, or superhero property.[235] Barbie became the
            highest-grossing live-action comedy film of all time, smashing the domestic record formerly held by Home
            Alone (1990) and the worldwide record formerly held by The Hangover Part II (2011) simultaneously.[236] It
            has also become Gerwig's highest-grossing film, overtaking its predecessor Little Women (2019).[237] The
            film crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide on August 6, 2023, making it the first film by a solo female
            director to do so.[238] This was also the fastest Warner Bros. film to reach $1 billion, beating Harry
            Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011).[239][240] In late August, Barbie surpassed that same film
            again, becoming Warner Bros.'s highest-grossing film, not adjusted for inflation.[241] By September 2, the
            film surpassed $1.365 billion at the global box office, replacing The Super Mario Bros. Movie as the
            highest-grossing film of the year.[242][243] Additionally, it became the highest-grossing film by a solo
            female director, surpassing the previous record held by Jia Ling for Hi, Mom (2021).[244]</p>

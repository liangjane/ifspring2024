        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>The idea of a live-action Barbie film was in development at Cannon Films in the mid-1980s. Renewed
            development on a film based on the Barbie toy line began in September 2009, when it was announced that
            Mattel had signed a partnership with Universal Pictures and producer Laurence Mark, but nothing came to
            fruition. In April 2014, Mattel teamed with Sony Pictures to produce the film, which would have Jenny Bicks
            writing the screenplay and Laurie MacDonald and Walter F. Parkes producing through their Parkes+MacDonald
            Image Nation banner. Filming was anticipated to begin by the end of the year. In March 2015, Diablo Cody was
            brought onto the project to rewrite the screenplay, and Amy Pascal joined the producing team.
        </p>
        <p>In December 2016, Amy Schumer entered negotiations for the title role with Winston's screenplay. She helped
            rewrite the script with her sister, Kim Caramele. In March 2017, she exited negotiations, initially saying
            it was due to scheduling conflicts with the planned June 2017 filming; she revealed in 2023 that she left
            due to creative differences with the film's producers. That July, Anne Hathaway was considered for the title
            role; Sony hired Olivia Milch to rewrite the screenplay and approached Alethea Jones to direct as a means of
            interesting Hathaway in signing. Jones was attached to direct by March 2018.
        </p>
        <p>In August 2018, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz hired film executive Robbie Brenner, who was later appointed head of
            Mattel Films. Sony's option on the project expired in October 2018, and film rights were transferred to
            Warner Bros. Pictures, causing Hathaway, Jones, Macdonald, Parkes and Pascal to leave them project. </p>
        <p>Margot Robbie entered early talks for the role, and Patty Jenkins was briefly considered as director. Kreiz
            was determined to cast Robbie after meeting with her; both he and Brenner felt that Robbie's appearance
            resembled that of a conventional Barbie doll and were impressed by her ideas. Initial meetings occurred at
            the Polo Lounge located in The Beverly Hills Hotel. Brenner eventually partnered with Robbie's production
            company, LuckyChap Entertainment, and Robbie's husband Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara were enlisted as
            producers. Robbie's casting was confirmed in July 2019.
        </p>
        <p>In her capacity as a producer, Robbie pitched Barbie to Warner Bros. herself. During the green-light meeting,
            she compared the film to Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park (1993) and also jokingly suggested that it would
            gross over $1 billion. Later on, she approached Greta Gerwig—whose previous films, particularly Little Women
            (2019), Robbie enjoyed—to screenwrite. Gerwig was in post-production for another film, and took the
            assignment on the condition that her partner, Noah Baumbach, also write the script. Gerwig would sign on to
            also direct the film in July 2021. Robbie said the film aimed at subverting expectations and giving
            audiences "the thing you didn't know you wanted."</p>

        <h2>Writing</h2>
        <p>As writers, Gerwig and Baumbach were given full creative freedom. They worked on the screenplay during the
            2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns at their house in Long Island. Baumbach felt he understood the film's
            purpose once Gerwig had shown him the first scene, identifying the "element" as "embracing mortality and
            sadness and sickness and everything that it means to be human." Gerwig was also inspired by the real-life
            story of Barbie creator Ruth Handler. Gerwig's film treatment consisted of an abstract poem on Barbie
            influenced by the Apostles' Creed. For the narrative arc, she was partially inspired by the non-fiction book
            Reviving Ophelia (1994) by Mary Pipher, which accounts the effects of societal pressures on American teenage
            girls. She also found inspiration in classic Technicolor musicals such as The Red Shoes (1948) and The
            Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964), and said: "They have such a high level of what we came to call authentic
            artificiality. You have a painted sky in a soundstage. Which is an illusion, but it's also really there. The
            painted backdrop is really there. The tangibility of the artifice is something that we kept going back
            to." The script also contains candid criticism of Mattel, which created skepticism among Mattel
            officials when they received the first version. However, Kreiz decided to trust Gerwig. Brenner noted that
            "being safe in this world doesn't work" as she interpreted Barbie to be a "bold" and "trailblazer" figure.
            As a result, Will Ferrell's portrayal as the Mattel CEO was meant to be an allegory for corporate America.
            Kreiz praised Ferrell and said that while Mattel officials took their brands seriously, they did not take
            themselves seriously. Gerwig and Robbie had felt the film was "most certainly a feminist film", but
            Mattel officials rejected the description. Gerwig and Robbie informed the studio that they would explore the
            controversies and problematic parts of Barbie, but also convinced the studio that they would respect the
            product.
        </p>
        <img id="greta" src="photos/greta.jpeg" alt="greta">
        <p>Gerwig was also influenced by her childhood experiences with Barbie. Her mother discouraged her from
            purchasing such dolls, but eventually allowed her to. Opting to acknowledge the controversial nature of
            the Barbie doll, Gerwig chose to create a film where she would be both "doing the thing and subverting the
            thing", in the sense that she would be celebrating the feminism behind Barbie while also noting the
            controversial beauty standards associated with it. She was also fascinated by the idea that humans created
            dolls, which in turn imitate humans, feeling that "we're in constant conversation with inanimate objects"
            while also conveying an affirmative message to the audience to "just be yourself and know that that's
            enough." The film deliberately juxtaposed contradictory messaging, such as critiquing consumerism yet
            glamorizing plastic products; and in the film's ending, where Barbie desires to be more than just a plastic
            doll. Gerwig made the film as an "earnest attempt to make amends" between affirming womens' worth and
            conveying the impossibility of perfection, which some perceived to be standards associated with
            Barbie.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reflecting upon the maximalism of Barbie, Gerwig said the "ontology of Barbie" was similar to what she
            perceived as William Shakespeare's maximalism, which she enjoyed in his works. She grounded the film in what
            she described as a "heightened theatricality that allows you to deal with big ideas in the midst of anarchic
            play." She also described the film as being anarchic, unhinged, and humanist. She felt the film
            originated from the "deep isolation of the pandemic", opining that the line in which Barbie says "Do you
            guys ever think about dying?" exemplifies the film's anarchic nature. She also found the idea of Barbie
            being "constrained in multitudes" as "all of these women are Barbie and Barbie is all of these women" to be
            "trippy" and felt as a result, Barbie did not need to have her own personal life, as she was attuned to her
            environment. She also described the story as mirroring a girl's journey from childhood to adolescence,
            though she did not deem it to be a coming of age film and felt that the film ultimately "ends up, really,
            about being human."
        </p>
        <p>
            Primarily, she began her writing by interpreting Barbie as living in a utopia and eventually experiencing
            reality, where she would have to "confront all the things that were shielded from them in this place
            [Barbieland]." She also drew parallels to the story of Adam and Eve and taking inspiration from John
            Milton's Paradise Lost, particularly being inspired by the concept that there is "no poetry without
            pain." To underscore the tragic elements of Barbie and Ken facing the real world, she focused on
            elements of dissonance. As such, she chose to keep a scene featuring Robbie's Barbie telling an older
            woman that she is beautiful after being requested to remove it, as she felt that the scene epitomized "the
            heart of the movie." She also desired to provide a "counterargument" to Barbie by featuring a scene in which
            Barbie learns that some women do not like her, and felt it gave the film "real intellectual and emotional
            power." As such, a scene is featured in which Barbie is being stared at inappropriately on the Venice
            Beach, which Gerwig chose to feature as she felt it was a universal experience, being especially relevant
            for actors. She was inspired by an audition she did in which she wore overalls and felt that she did not
            perform well in.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ending of the film features Barbie saying the line "I'm here to see my gynecologist", with Gerwig
            describing it as a "mic drop kind of joke." She had chosen to include the line as she had wanted to instill
            confidence in younger girls, as she had been embarrassed about her body when she was younger. Barbie
            also explores the negative consequences of hierarchical power structures, with Gerwig saying that she
            extrapolated that "Barbies rule and Kens are an underclass" and felt it was similar to the Planet of the
            Apes. Ken has low self-esteem and seeks approval from Barbie, which Gerwig identified as a good source
            for a story. Gosling compared Gerwig's vision to Milton Glaser's I Love New York logo as he felt Gerwig
            created the film's characters as a way of understanding the contemporary world. Ken has the only power
            ballad in the film, and Gerwig had identified it as the moment in which she felt the film transcended what a
            Barbie film traditionally should have been.</p>

        <h2>Set Design</h2>
        <p>Sarah Greenwood and Katie Spencer were the set designer and decorator, respectively, for Barbie. For the
            Barbie Dreamhouse, they drew inspiration from mid-century modernist architecture found in Palm Springs,
            including the 1946 Kaufmann Desert House by Richard Neutra, and the photography of Slim Aarons. Gerwig
            wanted to capture "what was so ridiculously fun about the Dreamhouses", alluding to its previous models, and
            referenced Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985), the paintings of Wayne Thiebaud, and the apartment of Gene
            Kelly's character in the Technicolor musical An American in Paris (1951). "Everything needed to be tactile,
            because toys are, above all, things you touch", Gerwig said of the use of practical effects instead of
            computer-generated imagery (CGI) to capture the sky and the San Jacinto Mountains. The set design is also
            noted for its extensive use of a specific shade of pink, Pantone 219. Rosco, the film's paint supplier,
            faced international shortages due to COVID-19-related supply-chain issues, as well as freezing temperatures
            that damaged stock; the film's sets required the company's entire remaining stock of pink.
            Because Gerwig also wanted to use practical builds, and had to film sequences in
            miniature models, then composite the footage onto the actual image. She began discussing the production
            design with cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Greenwood, and costume designer Jacqueline Durran a year in
            advance of filming. She also called director Peter Weir for inspiration on Barbie Land, with the idea of
            creating it as an "interior soundstage world".</p>

        <h2>Costumes</h2>
        <p>Costume designer Jacqueline Durran, who previously collaborated with Gerwig on Little Women (2019), employed
            a practical approach to create Barbie's wardrobe: "The defining characteristic of what she wears is where
            she's going and what she's doing, it's about being completely dressed for your job or task." To match the
            film's Barbieland setting, Durran and her team created costumes made of roughly fifteen color combinations
            "that riffed off the idea of a French Riviera beach in the early 1960s" and drew inspiration from actress
            Brigitte Bardot. For Ken's outfits, Durran zeroed in a look composed of colorful sportswear from the 1980s,
            while actor Ryan Gosling suggested a Ken-branded underwear for the character. Durran closely adapted outfits
            from past iterations of Barbie dolls, such as the 1993 "Western Stampin'" dolls and the 1994 "Hot Skatin'"
            dolls. She noted the Barbie dolls as "a very useful way to look at different ideas of femininity: what that
            means, who owns it, and who it's aimed at" and reflected this idea in how she dressed the characters. While
            the majority of the clothing featured in the film were sourced by Durran and her team, they also pulled
            pieces from the fashion archives of Chanel. Ivana Primorac was the lead hair and makeup artist for the
            film. In 2024, Primorac and Marie Larkin and Clare Corsick jointly won the Make-Up Artists and Hair
            Stylists Guild Award for Best Period and/or Character Hair Styling in a Feature-Length Motion Picture for
            Barbie.</p>

        <h2>Filming</h2>
        <p>Principal photography began on March 22, 2022, at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in England and wrapped on
            July 21. Among the notable locations was the Venice Beach Skatepark in Los Angeles, California.
            Rodrigo Prieto served as cinematographer. Prior to filming, Gerwig organized a sleepover with the female
            cast members for them to establish positive relationships, also feeling that it "would be the most fun way
            to kick everything off." She opted to use filming techniques from the 1950s (as Barbie had been a
            popular toy since 1959) to creating a period-accurate look. She also watched Powell and Pressburger's A
            Matter of Life and Death (1946) to understand how pre-digital visual effects were used to create
            theatricality. To highlight the tragic nature of Barbie and Ken facing the difficulties of the real world,
            she directed Robbie and Gosling to act as if they were in a drama.</p>
